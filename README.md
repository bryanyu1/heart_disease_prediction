# heart_prediction

A series of supervised machine learning models were developed, predicting the probability of patients to develop heart disease.

The data was downloaded from Kaggle via the following link:

After inspecting the data and building a data pipeline, I fit Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Logistic Regression CV, XGBoost, and LightGBM models. Concurrently, each model was inspected with various metrics and regularized to boost accuracy and performance.
